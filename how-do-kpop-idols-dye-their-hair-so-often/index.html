<p>Commonly many Kpop idols dye their hair with bold and bright colors. I notice that so many idols dye their hair like a lot and it usually doesnt look damaged. You can get nicer versions of these temporary colors its similar in texture to the pastel chalk craze that happened a few years ago that do the job for shoots and performances. Check in on the colour of your hair after 15 to 20 minutes and after leaving the dye in for the recommended time wash out.
