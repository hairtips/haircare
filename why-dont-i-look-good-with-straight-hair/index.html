<p><strong>Why Dont I Look Good With Straight Hair</strong>, Straight hair is rare there. Theres only one reason why hair can be the ultimate struggle - we want what we dont have. Its not that we cant have it we just dread the endless time of trial and error money effort and patience that goes along with it. Because of this straight hair remains strong during aggressive brushing braiding or styling.</p>

<p>I straightened my hair back in high school every day too and I got compliments so thats why I kept it up. Because of this straight hair remains strong during aggressive brushing braiding or styling. Straight looks good too though although I dont usually like overstyled hair so I wouldnt be attracted to someone who went mad with the hair gel etc. If you prefer the latter you should think about getting layers.</p>

<p>Thin and straight hair looks great if the hairdresser sticks to shallower layering as compared to spreading out the layering. Happy April Fools Day. My hair looks best almost straight- straightened with a lot of body and some wave. College life now I dont have the time nor care what people think of my wavy hair. Its wavy when wet but dries straight.</p>

<p>Happy April Fools Day. Xper 2 1 y. However I knew a guy in high school with the biggest curliest hair youve ever seen and he was very popular with the ladies.
