<p><strong>Can You Dye Asian Hair</strong>, To the disbelief of many some Asians are capable of having natural curls. Most Asian supermarkets especially Korean or Japanese have do-it-yourself hair dye that works primarily on Asian hair. Japanese hair dyes though formulated with dark black Asian hair in mind can also work great for other types of hair but always make sure to conduct a patch test in case. The reason is that dark hair has strong red orange and yellow pigment undertones.</p>

<p>Alternatively try Clairol Nice n Easy Color Blend Foam. If you do decide to color you Asian hair - you first need a game plan. As for the Japanase what I dont like is dyed color that looks artificial like if you have very black eyebrows and dye your hair platinum blonde its son unnatural that is. If the hair is not lifted enough during the lightening treatment the underlying result will be orange. Hair dyeing is one way to stand out of the crowds.</p>
