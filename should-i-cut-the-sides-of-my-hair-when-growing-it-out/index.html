<p><strong>Should I Cut The Sides Of My Hair When Growing It Out</strong>, Adding in a few layers of extensions can help ease the transition not to mention help you to practice styling long hair which will happen sooner than you think. If you already have long hair but want it even longer the key is to care for it and simply avoid split ends cutting it every eight weeks or six weeks if you also have layers and want to maintain them. Try parting your hair on the opposite side to hide the shaved side thats growing out. The cuts should be smooth and tapered.</p>
