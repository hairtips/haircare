<p>I get a haircut once a week maybe even every 4 days and my parents find it very odd and call me crazy but I dont think thats the case. Anything over an inch add a week for each inch of length. Our clients go much longer between cuts because they can because at four weeks their hair is longer than when it was last cut by us but it is still very much working for them. Black males often line up their haircuts at home with razors but all my black friends get theirs cut every 2 weeks or so also. Pin On Hairstyles.</p>
