Pixie cuts and other short hairstyles look ugly on most not-thin-girls and women Im a not-thin-girl Hear me out I know some of you will be offended by this opinion but let me explain why I think those hairstyles looks weird on women and girls of a certain body type. Well some girls can rock it and some cant you have too have the right head for it or it will look stupid. As long as you give her a cut that works best with her head shape and facial features.

<p>The haircut and your facial features shapes and sizes of your eyes eyebrows nose chin forehead and face. Im at my wits end with my hair even after trying to work with its texture and trying different styles and products over my life. This look generally works best on oval face shapes and fine hair but those with other face shapes and thick hair can still support a pixie as long as the look is adapted to them. And Im worried that a cut that short will emphasise my chubbiness. Pin On Hair.</p>
