<p>I never straightened my hair before but my friend says she can do it for today if i want. And of course lets not be naive to the fact that straight hair is the easiest to manage you cant have a bad hair day with straight hair. My hair is naturally curly and thats how i usually wear it. Not really straight hair doesnt suit my face. Pin On Long Bob.</p>
